##Development Notes:
* `mk` anims are in isotemp.mix (or isosno.. etc)
* `gg`/`ng` anims are in generic.mix
* `icon`s are in cameo.mix
* infantry are in conquer.mix

Sequence 'Tick' properties are the number of milliseconds per frame.

Tile type indices:
* 00 = Clear
* 01 = Ice
* 02 = Unknown
* 03 = Unknown
* 04 = Unknown
* 05 = Tunnel
* 06 = Railroad
* 07 = Rock
* 08 = Unknown
* 09 = Water
* 10 = Beach
* 11 = Road
* 12 = Some LAT Transitions
* 13 = Mostly Slopes
* 14 = Rough
* 15 = Cliff

Wall, Tiberium, and Weeds are somewhere in this list,
  even though they are overlays and not tiletypes,
  because they affect actor movement speed.
